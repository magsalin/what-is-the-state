What is the state, why are anarchists opposed to it, and how do we abolish it? 
The naming of our demons is one of the first steps to exorcising it and as anarchists we need to understand the phenomena of the state if we are to effectively oppose it. 
While there are a wealth of literature both anarchist and Marxist that analyze capital and capitalism, there are curiously less such literature explaining the phenomena of the state itself. This essay reviews and summarize four definitions of the state. Being a short and digestible piece, our discussion is not meant to be comprehensive.

## Statism

What would we call statist? Statism is the idea that a certain action prefigures a state, or perhaps constituting an embryo for a future state. So institutions like a party bureaucracy and cadre would be called statist because these essentially prefigure state machinery. After all, a party is a state-in-waiting.

From Kropotkinâ€™s institutional definition of a state, statism is then a concentration of power and of functions in the hands of the few.
